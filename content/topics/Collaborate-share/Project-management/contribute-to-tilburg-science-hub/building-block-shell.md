## Overview <!-- Goal of the Building Block -->

Provide a brief overview of the issue to solve, or describe why this is a best practice.

Add any special requirements or attach a dummy data set if needed.


## Code <!-- Provide your code in all the relevant languages and/or operating systems and specify them after the three back ticks. Do NOT remove % codeblock % -->

{{% codeblock %}} <!-- You can provide more than one language in the same code block -->

[python-link](code.py) <!-- OPTIONAL: You can also provide your code as a downloadable file (useful for very long codes). Make sure you place this file in the same folder. Specify in [square brackets] the language followed by "-link" as shown here.-->


```python
# some Python code here
print("Hello, world!")
```

```R
# some R code here
cat('Hello, world!')
```

{{% /codeblock %}}


## Examples

Provide examples to support the solution.

{{% example %}}

This is an example. It will be formatted differently to grab the viewer's attention.

{{% /example %}}


### You can use third- or fourth-level headers like this one

Provide examples in different programming languages and/or operating systems.

{{% tip %}}

**This is a tip.**

You can use special formatting options to highlight some paragraphs in your article.

{{% /tip %}}

{{% warning %}}

And this is a warning.

{{% /warning %}}

## Advanced use cases or "See also"

Illustrate advanced use cases and explain how to bring this to the next level.

Provide useful resources and link to "see also" articles.

{{% summary %}}

Lastly, include a brief summary to wrap up your article.
